This file contains an implementation of a class of complex numbers:
Complex() - create a zero complex number;
Complex(double r, double i) - create complex number with real part r and imaginary part i;
getre() - return real part of complex number;
setre(double r) - set real part of complex number to r;
getim() - return imaginary part part of complex number;
setim(double ri) - set imaginary part part of complex number to i;
Add/sub/mul/cdiv(Complex) - standard arithmetic operations with two complex numbers;
isequal(Complex/double) - return comparison of 2 complex numbers or complex with double number;
power(int) - return exponentiation of complex number;
mod() - return module of complex number;
display() - output complex number to the console.

Ð¡ode is covered by google tests (gtest).
